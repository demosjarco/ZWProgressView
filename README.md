ZWProgressView
==============
So I had a quesion on github on how to make a UIProgressView and have a UILabel in the middle that would reflect the percentage, but have that text change color dude to the overlapping when the progress bar passed it. so this guy named <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/860967/zhang">Zhang</a> on Stack Overflow was kind enough and put something together. It worked really nice, but I wanted to add more features and functionality to it. So I want to give credit to him for the original code. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24275603/uilabel-over-uiprogressview-with-multiple-colors">Here</a> is the original post with the answer.
